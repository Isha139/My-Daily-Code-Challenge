# My-Daily-Code-Challenge
This is my Daily Code Challenge, Challenging myself to stay consistent in coding and track my progress journey.
# Day 1
# Q1. Count Digit
# Day 2
# Q2. There is a song concert going to happen in the city. The price of each ticket is equal to the number obtained after reversing the bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer ‘n’.
# Q3. Check whether a given number ’n’ is a palindrome number.
# Day 3
# Q4. You are given an integer 'n'. Return 'true' if 'n' is an Armstrong number, and 'false' otherwise.
# Day 4
# Q5. You are given an integer ‘n’.Function ‘sumOfDivisors(n)’ is defined as the sum of all divisors of ‘n’.Find the sum of ‘sumOfDivisors
# Find the sum of ‘sumOfDivisors(i)’ for all ‘i’ from 1 to ‘n’.
# Day 5
# Q6. A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible by exactly 2 integers, 1 and the number itself.You are given a number 'n'.
# Find out whether 'n' is prime or not.
# Q7. You are given two integers 'n', and 'm'.Calculate 'gcd(n,m)', without using library functions.
# Day 6 (Recursion Basics)
# Q8. You are given an integer ‘n’.Your task is to return an array containing integers from 1 to ‘n’ (in increasing order) without using loops 
# mistyped day 6 as day 7 during commit.
# Day 7
# Q9. You are given an integer ‘n’.Print “Coding Ninjas ” ‘n’ times, without using a loop.
# Q10. You are given an integer ‘n’.Your task is to return an array containing integers from ‘n’ to ‘1’ (in decreasing order) without using loops.
# Day 8
# Q11. Print numbers from N to 1 (space separated) without the help of loops.
# Day 9
# Q12. Given an integer n, calculate the sum of series 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + … till n-th term.
# Day 10
# Q13. The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1,  F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
# Q14. Reverse of an Array using recursion.
# Q15. Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
# Day 11
# Q16. Count frequency of a number using hasing.
# Q17. Count frequency of String(lower case) using hashing.
# Q18. Count frequency of String(lowercase & Uppercase) using hashing.
# Day 12
# Q19. Find Highest and Lowest Frequency of an element using Hashing.
# Day 13
# Q21. Selection Sort
# Day 14
# Q20. Bubble Sort
# Day 15
# Q22. Insertion Sort
# Break because of end semesters examination, but from today onwards back on track.
# Day 1
# Q23. Merge Sort
# Day 2
# Q24. Quick Sort
# Day 3
# Q25. 	Recursive Insertion Sort
# Q26. Recursive Selection Sort
# Day 4
# Q27. Given an array, we have to find the largest element in the array.
# Day 5
# Q28. Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.
# Q29. Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.
# Day 6
# Q30. Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
# Q31. Given an array of N integers, right rotate the array by one place
# Q32. Given an array of N integers, left rotate the array by one place
# Day 7
# Q33. Given an array of integers, rotating array of elements by k elements left.
# Q34. Given an array of integers, rotating array of elements by k elements right.
# Q35. Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
# Day 8
# Q36. Given an array arr[] sorted in ascending order of size N and an integer K. Check if K is present in the array or not.
# Q37. Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union. The Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays. Return the elements in sorted order.
